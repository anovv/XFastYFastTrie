XFastYFastTrie
==============
Y-Fast Trie â€“ advanced data structure, which allows fast in-order successor/predecessor queries in a bounded universe of integers with a small amount of memory (unlike Van Emde Boas Tree). Built as a mix of X-Fast Trie and self-balancing binary trees (I used my implementation of AVL Tree). Supports insert, delete, find, successor/predecessor operations
